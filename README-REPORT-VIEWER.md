# Beet Guru Report Viewer Implementation

## Overview

This feature enhances the Beet Guru application with a detailed Report Viewer that allows farmers to view comprehensive information about their completed crop assessments. The Report Viewer is integrated with the existing Reports screen, providing a seamless experience for users to access detailed report information.

## Key Components

### 1. ReportViewerScreen

A new screen component that displays a detailed view of a single report, including:

- **Navigation Header**: With "Back to Reports" button and "Share Report" action
- **Report Header**: Showing report title, date, location, cultivar, and season with appropriate icons
- **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the assessment findings
- **Two-Column Layout**: For crop information and field measurements
- **Results Section**:
  - Yield Estimate card with total field yield
  - Feeding Capacity card for a specified number of animals
  - Yield visualization showing leaf, bulb, and total yields with graphical representation
- **Recommendations**: Actionable items for farmers based on the assessment
- **Notes**: Additional context and observations

### 2. Updated ReportsScreen

Enhanced the existing ReportsScreen to:

- Handle report selection through row clicks or explicit view actions
- Navigate between the reports list and detailed report view
- Maintain filter and sorting capabilities

### 3. Enhanced API Service

Created an enhanced API service that extends the mock data with more detailed information:

- Additional report details including executive summary, recommendations, and notes
- Yield breakdown data for visualization (leaf, bulb, and total components)

## Implementation Details

1. **Navigation Flow**:
   - User clicks on a report in the list view (table on desktop, cards on mobile)
   - The selected report ID is stored in component state
   - The ReportViewerScreen is rendered with the report data
   - User can navigate back to the reports list

2. **Data Flow**:
   - ReportViewerScreen fetches both report and assessment data
   - Data is combined to provide a comprehensive view
   - Enhanced API service provides additional details not available in the original API

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Consistent with Beet Guru's design system
   - Card-based layout with subtle shadows
   - Green primary color for key numbers and icons
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

4. **User Experience**:
   - Appropriate loading and error states
   - Back navigation for easy return to reports list
   - Share action for sending reports

## Technical Implementation

- Uses React hooks for state management and API calls
- Leverages existing UI components (FormButton, icons)
- Implements responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Extends the existing API service without modifying it

## Future Enhancements

1. **PDF Export**: Add functionality to export reports as PDF documents
2. **Email Integration**: Implement actual email sending for the "Share Report" action
3. **Comparison View**: Allow comparing multiple reports side by side
4. **Interactive Charts**: Replace static visualizations with interactive charts
5. **Historical Data**: Show trends across multiple assessments for the same location

## Dependencies

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Custom hooks for API calls and device detection
