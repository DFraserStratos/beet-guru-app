# Beet Guru Report Viewer Implementation

## Overview

This feature enhances the Beet Guru application with a detailed Report Viewer that allows farmers to review comprehensive information about their completed crop assessments. The implementation follows a document-like design approach, presenting all report data in a single cohesive card with clearly defined sections.

## Key Components

### ReportViewerScreen

The main component that displays a detailed view of a selected report with the following sections:

1. **Navigation Header**
   - Standalone "Back to Reports" button with left arrow icon
   - "Share Report" button with share icon
   - Both using the FormButton component with outline variant for consistent UI

2. **Report Document**
   - Single card design with white background and subtle shadow
   - Sections separated with light borders for clear organization
   - Document-like layout that flows logically from summary to details

3. **Document Sections**
   - **Report Header**: Title and metadata (date, location, cultivar, season)
   - **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of key findings
   - **Crop Information**: Details about crop type, cultivar, dates, and water type
   - **Field Measurements**: Technical details about row spacing, area, and dry matter
   - **Results**: Highlighted yield estimate and feeding capacity with visual breakdown
   - **Recommendations**: Actionable advice with checkmark bullets
   - **Notes**: Additional context and disclaimers

### Integration Points

The Report Viewer is integrated with the application at two key points:

1. **Reports Screen Integration**
   - Enhanced ReportsScreen to handle report selection
   - Added navigation between reports list and detailed view
   - Preserved filtering and sorting capabilities

2. **Assessment Workflow Integration**
   - "Generate Report" button in the Review step of the assessment wizard now navigates directly to the Report Viewer
   - Shows the newly generated report immediately after completion
   - Maintains proper back navigation to return to the main application flow

### Enhanced API Service

- Extended the mock API with detailed report information
- Added executive summary, recommendations, and notes
- Provided yield breakdown data for visualization

## Design Details

### Visual Design

- **Document Approach**: All content is contained within a single card for a cohesive experience
- **Section Hierarchy**: Clear visual separation between sections with subtle borders
- **Color Usage**: 
  - White background for main content
  - Pale green background for the Results section to make it stand out
  - Green accents for important data points and icons
- **Typography**: 
  - Consistent text sizes and weights for headers and content
  - Clear distinction between labels and values
- **Icons**: Strategic use of icons to provide visual context for different data types

### Desktop Layout

- Two-column layout for Crop Information and Field Measurements sections
- Side-by-side cards for Yield Estimate and Feeding Capacity
- Generous spacing for optimal readability
- Centered yield visualization with clear labels

### Mobile Layout

- Stack columns and cards vertically
- Maintain the same section ordering
- Adjust spacing for touch-friendly interaction
- Preserve all content with appropriate sizing

## Implementation Notes

### Data Flow

1. **Reports List Flow**:
   - User clicks on a report in the ReportsScreen
   - Selected report ID is stored and used to render the ReportViewerScreen
   - User can navigate back to the reports list via the back button

2. **Assessment Completion Flow**:
   - User completes an assessment and clicks "Generate Report"
   - Assessment is saved and a report is generated
   - User is immediately shown the new report in the ReportViewerScreen
   - User can return to the main application workflow via the back button

### Technical Implementation

- **React Hooks**: Used for state management and API calls
- **Conditional Rendering**: Appropriate handling of loading and error states
- **API Integration**: Enhanced API service for more detailed report data
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes
- **Component Reuse**: Leverages existing UI components for consistency

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Information Display**
   - All relevant assessment data in one view
   - Clear organization of information by category

2. **Highlighted Results**
   - Prominent display of key metrics (yield and feeding capacity)
   - Visual breakdown of yield components (leaf, bulb, total)
   - Supporting context for the calculations

3. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Visually emphasized with checkmark bullets
   - Clear, concise advice for farmers
   - Practical next steps based on assessment results

4. **Document-Like Experience**
   - Feels like a professional report rather than a web interface
   - Logical flow of information from summary to details
   - Consistent styling throughout

5. **Seamless Navigation**
   - Easy return to reports list or assessment workflow
   - Share functionality for distribution
