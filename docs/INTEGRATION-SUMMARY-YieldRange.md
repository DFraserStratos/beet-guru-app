# YieldRangeVisualization Component - Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully created and integrated the YieldRangeVisualization component into the Beet Guru app's ReportViewerScreen.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component Created
- **YieldRangeVisualization.js** - A reusable React component that displays:
  - Horizontal bar chart comparing current vs. additional sample yield estimates
  - Confidence intervals shown as bar ranges
  - Mean values displayed above bars
  - Grid lines at key values (11, 17, 23)
  - Two-column statistics table below the chart
  - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

### 2. Component Features
- Accepts `currentData` and `additionalData` props for customization
- Default values based on typical beet crop yields
- Color-coded visualization (green for current, blue for additional samples)
- Clean, modern design matching the app's visual language
- Mobile-responsive layout

### 3. Integration into ReportViewerScreen
- Replaced the existing basic yield visualization with the new component
- Added logic to calculate visualization data from assessment data
- Positioned within the Results section with proper styling
- Maintains the existing report layout and flow

### 4. Supporting Files
- **YieldRangeVisualization.test.js** - Comprehensive unit tests
- **YieldVisualizationDemo.js** - Demo screen for testing
- **README-YieldRangeVisualization.md** - Complete documentation

## Usage Example
```jsx
<YieldRangeVisualization 
  currentData={{
    mean: 17.2,
    upperLimit: 22.6,
    lowerLimit: 11.8,
    bulbYield: 14.3,
    leafYield: 2.9
  }}
  additionalData={{
    mean: 18.0,
    upperLimit: 21.4,
    lowerLimit: 14.7,
    bulbYield: 15.1,
    leafYield: 2.9
  }}
/>
```

## Testing
The component has been integrated into the ReportViewerScreen and can be viewed by:
1. Logging into the app
2. Navigating to Reports
3. Viewing any report

The visualization will display in the Results section, showing how additional samples could improve yield estimate precision.
