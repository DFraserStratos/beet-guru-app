# Progress Bar Bug Fixes

This update addresses two specific issues with the progress bar in the assessment wizard:

1. **Bar Extending Past Checkpoints**: The progress bar was extending beyond the first and last checkpoint dots
2. **Missing Progress**: The progress bar wasn't advancing correctly when stepping through the form

## Technical Solution

The solution uses precise DOM measurements and absolute positioning to:

1. **Fix the Bar Extending Past Dots**:
   - The progress bar now starts exactly at the first dot's center position
   - Width is calculated in exact pixels to end at the appropriate dot
   - Bar is absolutely positioned with explicit `left` property

2. **Fix the Missing Progress**:
   - Implementation now correctly calculates the endpoint for each step
   - For Step 1: No progress (width: 0)
   - For Step 2: Progress from dot 1 to dot 1
   - For Step 3: Progress from dot 1 to dot 2
   - For Step 4: Progress from dot 1 to dot 3

## Implementation Details

The key changes include:

1. **State Management**:
   - Changed from a single width state to a style object with width and left properties
   - This allows more precise control over both the size and position of the progress bar

2. **Exact Positioning**:
   - Used `position: absolute` with specific coordinates based on dot positions
   - Explicit width in pixels rather than percentages
   - Explicit left position to start at the first dot

3. **Improved Dimensions Calculation**:
   - Calculates the exact position of all dots on mount and when step changes
   - Gets the center point of each dot relative to the container
   - Sets width to the exact distance between dots

4. **Clean and Maintainable Code**:
   - Better variable names for clarity
   - Improved comments explaining the logic
   - Cleaner style structure

## Benefits

1. **Visual Accuracy**: Progress bar now aligns perfectly with dots
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Bar now progresses correctly through all steps
3. **Improved UX**: Users get accurate visual feedback on their progress
4. **No Layout Shifts**: Fixed positioning prevents the bar from causing layout issues
5. **Proper Visual Boundaries**: Bar stays within the intended area

## Before vs. After

**Before**:
- Bar extended past the first and last dots
- Progress wasn't visible when moving between steps
- Positioning was percentage-based, causing alignment issues

**After**:
- Bar starts and ends exactly at dot centers
- Progress shows correctly for each step
- Absolute positioning with exact pixel values ensures proper alignment
