# Settings Screen Implementation

This branch adds a focused Settings screen to the Beet Guru application with three essential sections:

## Features Added

### 1. Settings Screen with Key Sections
- **Profile Information**: Manage user details (name, email, role, phone)
- **Farm Details**: Store farm information including address, region, and country
- **Security**: Password management

### 2. Responsive Design
- Desktop view with sidebar navigation for settings categories
- Mobile view with multiple navigation options:
  - Tab buttons at the top for quick section switching
  - Next/Previous buttons at the bottom for sequential navigation
  - Dropdown selector for direct access to any section
- Consistent styling matching the rest of the application

### 3. Farm Address Management
Added ability to manage farm address information including:
- Farm name
- Street address
- City/Town
- Postal code
- Region (Canterbury)
- Country (New Zealand)

## Implementation Details

- Created `SettingsScreen.js` component in the screens directory
- Updated `App.js` to use the new component instead of the placeholder
- Leveraged existing form components and hooks for consistent UI
- Added redundant mobile navigation options to ensure users can easily navigate between sections
- Mobile and desktop optimized layouts

## Mobile Navigation Improvements

The initial implementation had an issue with mobile navigation between sections. The following improvements were made:

1. **Tab-Style Navigation**: Added horizontal tab buttons at the top of the settings content for intuitive navigation between sections
2. **Next/Previous Buttons**: Added buttons at the bottom of each section to facilitate sequential navigation
3. **Enhanced Dropdown**: Improved the dropdown select component with proper event handling and visual cues
4. **Debugging Helpers**: Added console logging for navigation state changes to assist with debugging

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to Settings using either:
   - The Settings option in the "More" tab (mobile)
   - The Settings link in the sidebar (desktop)
3. Verify that all settings sections display correctly
4. On mobile, test all navigation methods:
   - Tap the tab buttons at the top
   - Use the dropdown selector
   - Use the Next/Previous buttons at the bottom
5. Test form input validation and submission
6. Verify responsive design by testing on different screen sizes

Note: In this implementation, saving settings will only log them to the console, since there's no backend integration yet.

## Future Improvements

For future iterations:
- Add form validation for all inputs
- Implement actual data persistence through API calls
- Add user avatar upload functionality
- Add additional settings sections as needed (notifications, preferences, etc.)
