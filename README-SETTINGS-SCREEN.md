# Settings Screen Implementation

This branch adds a focused Settings screen to the Beet Guru application with three essential sections:

## Features Added

### 1. Settings Screen with Key Sections
- **Profile Information**: Manage user details (name, email, role, phone)
- **Farm Details**: Store farm information including address, region, and country
- **Security**: Password management

### 2. Responsive Design
- Desktop view with sidebar navigation for settings categories
- Mobile view with dropdown selection for settings categories
- Consistent styling matching the rest of the application

### 3. Farm Address Management
Added ability to manage farm address information including:
- Farm name
- Street address
- City/Town
- Postal code
- Region (Canterbury)
- Country (New Zealand)

## Implementation Details

- Created `SettingsScreen.js` component in the screens directory
- Updated `App.js` to use the new component instead of the placeholder
- Leveraged existing form components and hooks for consistent UI
- Mobile and desktop optimized layouts

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to Settings using either:
   - The Settings option in the "More" tab (mobile)
   - The Settings link in the sidebar (desktop)
3. Verify that all settings sections display correctly
4. Test form input validation and submission
5. Verify responsive design by testing on different screen sizes

Note: In this implementation, saving settings will only log them to the console, since there's no backend integration yet.

## Future Improvements

For future iterations:
- Add form validation for all inputs
- Implement actual data persistence through API calls
- Add user avatar upload functionality
- Add additional settings sections as needed (notifications, preferences, etc.)
