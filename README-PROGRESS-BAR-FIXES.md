# Progress Bar Alignment Fix

This update addresses two specific issues with the progress bar in the Beet Guru app:

1. **Bar Extending Past Checkpoints**: The progress bar was extending beyond the first and last checkpoint dots.
2. **Misaligned Progress**: The progress bar wasn't correctly aligning with the checkpoint dots at different stages of the form.

## Solution Overview

The solution implements a precise DOM-based measurement approach to ensure the progress bar aligns perfectly with each checkpoint dot:

### 1. Exact Position Calculation

- The component now uses DOM measurements to calculate the exact position of each dot
- Progress bar width and position are set based on these measurements
- The progress bar now stops exactly at each checkpoint dot, rather than extending past

### 2. Step-Specific Progress

- Progress is calculated to move exactly from the first dot to the appropriate dot for the current step
- For Step 1: No progress bar is shown
- For Steps 2+: Progress bar extends from the first dot to the dot of the previous step
- This ensures the bar matches the visual state of the form process

### 3. CSS Grid Structure

- Maintained the grid-based layout for consistent spacing
- Added proper z-index to ensure dots appear above the track
- Improved the positioning logic for the progress bar with `marginLeft` property

## Technical Implementation

### Position Calculation

The component now:

1. Gets a reference to the container element
2. Finds all dots using the `.step-dot` class
3. Calculates the exact center position of each dot relative to the container
4. Sets the exact width and position for the progress bar based on these measurements

### Progress Bar Positioning

Instead of using percentage-based width calculations:

- Width is set to the exact pixel distance between dots
- Position is set using `marginLeft` to start exactly at the first dot
- The bar no longer extends to the edges of the container

### State Management

- Added state to track the progress bar style properties
- Updates the style when the step changes
- Uses a useEffect hook to recalculate positions when needed

## Benefits

1. **Precise Visual Alignment**: The progress bar now aligns perfectly with each checkpoint dot
2. **Correct Progress Indication**: The progress bar accurately represents the current step in the form
3. **No Extending Past Edges**: The bar now stays within the bounds of the first and last dots
4. **Improved User Experience**: The visual feedback is now more accurate and intuitive

This implementation ensures the progress bar provides accurate visual feedback to users as they progress through the multi-step form process.
