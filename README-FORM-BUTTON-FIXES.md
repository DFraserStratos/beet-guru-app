# Form Button Fixes

This update addresses issues with the form button layout and spacing in the mobile view of the assessment forms. The primary goals of this update were to:

1. Improve mobile usability by creating a clear button hierarchy
2. Prevent accidental taps on destructive actions
3. Create a consistent and predictable button layout across all forms
4. Optimize for thumb access on mobile devices
5. Maintain the existing desktop layout for larger screens

## Key Changes

### 1. New FormButtonNav Component

Created a new reusable component for form navigation buttons that:
- Adapts its layout based on screen size (mobile vs. desktop)
- Follows a standardized pattern for button order and hierarchy
- Shows primary action buttons at the bottom for easy thumb access on mobile
- Provides appropriate spacing between buttons to prevent accidental taps
- Makes all buttons full-width on mobile for easier tapping

### 2. Mobile-Optimized Layout

For mobile devices, the new layout:
- Stacks buttons vertically in order of importance
- Places the primary action button at the bottom for easy thumb access
- Makes all buttons full-width for larger tap targets
- Provides clear visual distinction between primary, secondary, and destructive actions
- Includes appropriate spacing between buttons to prevent accidental taps

### 3. Consistent Button Hierarchy

The buttons now follow a consistent hierarchy:
1. Primary action (Continue/Generate Report): Most prominent, green background
2. Back: Secondary action when applicable
3. Save as Draft: Less prominent but still visible
4. Cancel: Least prominent to minimize accidental data loss

### 4. Desktop Layout Preservation

The desktop layout has been preserved with its existing horizontal arrangement for consistency with the rest of the application.

## Implementation Details

1. Created new `FormButtonNav` component that handles both mobile and desktop layouts
2. Updated all assessment step components to use the new component
3. Passed the `isMobile` prop through from the parent components
4. Maintained all existing functionality while improving the visual layout
5. Added appropriate spacing and styling for better tap targets

## Testing

The changes have been tested for:
- Mobile layout across all assessment steps
- Desktop layout preservation
- Proper button behavior
- Responsive design across different screen sizes
- Visual consistency with the rest of the application

## Future Considerations

1. Similar pattern could be applied to other forms in the application for consistency
2. May consider enhancing the component with animations or transitions for better user feedback
3. Future user testing could validate the effectiveness of the new layout
