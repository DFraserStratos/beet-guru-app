# Code Refactoring for Enhanced Maintainability

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring performed on the Beet Guru application to improve its maintainability, scalability, and code organization.

## Overview

The refactoring focused on restructuring the codebase to improve separation of concerns, reduce code duplication, and establish patterns for future development. The UI/UX remains visually identical to the original implementation while providing a more maintainable foundation.

## Key Refactoring Areas

### 1. Custom Hooks

A new `hooks` directory was created with several reusable hooks:

- **useDeviceDetection**: Centralizes responsive behavior detection
  ```javascript
  // Before
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768);
    };
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);
  
  // After
  const isMobile = useDeviceDetection(768);
  ```

- **useForm**: Standardizes form handling and validation
  ```javascript
  // Before
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});
  
  // After
  const { values, errors, handleChange, handleBlur, handleSubmit } = useForm(
    { email: '', password: '' },
    validateLogin,
    onSubmit
  );
  ```

- **useLocalStorage**: Enables persistent state storage
  ```javascript
  // Before
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  // After
  const [user, setUser] = useLocalStorage('beet-guru-user', null);
  ```

- **useApi**: Standardizes API calls with loading/error states
  ```javascript
  // Before
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  // After
  const { data, loading, error, execute } = useApi(api.assessments.getAll);
  ```

### 2. Error Boundary Implementation

Added ErrorBoundary component to catch and handle JavaScript errors gracefully:

```javascript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ComponentThatMightFail />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

Features:
- Catches errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors
- Displays a user-friendly fallback UI instead of crashing
- Provides a "Try again" button to recover from errors
- Logs error details to the console for debugging

### 3. Data Fetching Layer

Created a service layer for API calls in preparation for backend integration:

```
src/services/
└── api.js      # Centralized API service with mock data
```

Features:
- Standardized error handling and timeout behavior
- Structured API methods for different data types:
  - `authAPI`: Authentication methods (login, register)
  - `assessmentsAPI`: Assessment CRUD operations
  - `reportsAPI`: Report generation and management
  - `referencesAPI`: Reference data (locations, cultivars, etc.)
- Simulated API delays for realistic behavior
- Mock data that mirrors the expected backend structure

### 4. Form Handling Abstraction

Created reusable form components for consistent styling and behavior:

```
src/components/ui/form/
├── FormField.js    # Flexible input field component
├── FormButton.js   # Standardized button component
└── index.js        # Export barrel
```

Features:
- **FormField** supports various input types:
  - Text, email, password, number inputs
  - Select dropdowns
  - Checkboxes
  - Textareas
- Standardized error display and validation
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Accessibility improvements
- **FormButton** provides standardized button styling with variants:
  - Primary, secondary, outline, danger, link
  - Loading state support
  - Icon support
  - Size variants

### 5. Component Composition

Split the large NewAssessmentScreen.js (30KB+) into smaller, focused components:

```
src/components/assessment/
├── StepProgress.js      # Wizard progress indicator
├── CropDetailsStep.js   # Step 1: Crop information
├── FieldSetupStep.js    # Step 2: Field configuration
├── MeasurementsStep.js  # Step 3: Sample measurements
├── ReviewStep.js        # Step 4: Review and generate reports
└── index.js             # Export barrel
```

Benefits:
- Each component has a clear, focused responsibility
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Easier testing and debugging
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced file sizes (from 30KB to ~3KB for main component)

## Updated Project Structure

The refactored project structure now includes:

```
src/
├── components/       # UI components
│   ├── assessment/   # Assessment wizard components
│   ├── layout/       # Layout components (Sidebar, Header, BottomNav)
│   ├── screens/      # Main screen components
│   ├── ui/           # UI elements (widgets, forms, etc.)
│   └── utility/      # Utility components (ErrorBoundary, etc.)
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── services/         # API services
└── utils/            # Helper functions
```

## Implementation Example: Form Refactoring

Before (inline form elements):
```jsx
<div>
  <label htmlFor="email" className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">
    Email address
  </label>
  <div className="mt-1 relative rounded-md shadow-sm">
    <div className="absolute inset-y-0 left-0 pl-3 flex items-center pointer-events-none">
      <User size={18} className="text-gray-400" />
    </div>
    <input
      id="email"
      name="email"
      type="email"
      autoComplete="email"
      value={email}
      onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
      className="block w-full pl-10 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-green-500 focus:border-green-500 text-sm"
      placeholder="you@example.com"
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

After (using FormField component):
```jsx
<FormField
  label="Email address"
  name="email"
  type="email"
  placeholder="you@example.com"
  value={values.email}
  onChange={handleChange}
  onBlur={handleBlur}
  error={errors.email}
  touched={touched.email}
  icon={<User size={18} className="text-gray-400" />}
/>
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Reduced code duplication** through reusable hooks and components
2. **Improved separation of concerns** with focused components
3. **Enhanced maintainability** with smaller, more manageable files
4. **Better error handling** with error boundaries
5. **Preparation for backend integration** with the API service layer
6. **Consistent user experience** through standardized form components
7. **Preserved UI/UX** while improving the underlying architecture

## Future Development Considerations

The refactoring sets the stage for:

1. **Backend Integration**
   - The API service layer makes it easy to replace mock data with real API calls
   - Consistent error handling and loading states are already implemented
   - Local storage integration for persistence is ready to use

2. **State Management Evolution**
   - Current hook-based approach can scale to Context API if needed
   - Clear patterns established for managing component-level state
   - Form state handling is standardized and reusable

3. **Testing Implementation**
   - Smaller, focused components are easier to test
   - Hooks can be tested independently
   - Error boundaries provide predictable failure modes

4. **Routing Implementation**
   - Component structure is ready for React Router integration
   - Clear separation of screens and components
   - Navigation logic is centralized and consistent

## Getting Started with the Refactored Code

If you're a developer working on this project, here are the key things to know:

1. **Use the custom hooks** whenever possible:
   - `useDeviceDetection` for responsive behavior
   - `useForm` for form handling
   - `useLocalStorage` for persistent state
   - `useApi` for data fetching

2. **Leverage the form components**:
   - `<FormField>` for all form inputs
   - `<FormButton>` for buttons with consistent styling

3. **Use the Card component**:
   - Wrap content with `<Card>` (`src/components/ui/Card.js`) for the common white container style

4. **Follow the component composition pattern**:
   - Break large components into smaller, focused ones
   - Group related components in dedicated directories
   - Use index.js files for clean exports

5. **Wrap key components with error boundaries**:
   - Use at the top level of screens
   - Use for critical functionality that shouldn't crash the app
   - Consider custom fallbacks for specific components

6. **Use the API service for data fetching**:
   - Import from `src/services/api.js`
   - Pair with `useApi` hook for loading/error states
   - Follow the established patterns for new endpoints
