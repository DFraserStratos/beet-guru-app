# Assessments and Reports Update (May 2025)

This update introduces a significant change to how assessments and reports are managed in the Beet Guru app, creating a clearer separation between in-progress assessments and completed reports.

## Key Changes

### Assessments Screen
- **Changed from Table to Location Cards**: The assessments screen now displays location cards instead of a table of assessments
- **Location Status Indicators**: Each location now has a status:
  - **Draft**: Indicates an assessment is in progress for this location
  - **Not Started**: Indicates no assessment has been started yet
- **Action-Based Navigation**: 
  - Clicking "Start Assessment" on a Not Started location creates a new assessment with the location prefilled
  - Clicking "Continue Assessment" on a Draft location continues the in-progress assessment
- **Simplified Interface**: Removed filtering options to focus on location-based workflow

### Reports Screen
- **Desktop View**: Table-based layout showing all completed reports
- **Mobile View**: Card-based layout optimized for vertical scrolling
- **Simplified Information**: Removed Status and Report Type columns/information as requested
- **Focus on Key Data**: Each report shows Date, Report Title, Location, and Actions
- **Historical Data**: Added reports spanning multiple years for better historical analysis

### Code Improvements
- **Created New Components**:
  - `LocationCard.js`: Reusable component for displaying location with status
  - `AssessmentTable.js`: Reusable table component for displaying tabular data
- **Updated API**: 
  - Added location status and draft assessment references
  - Added methods to fetch locations with their status
  - Added methods to get only completed assessments
- **Enhanced Navigation**:
  - Added state for selectedLocation and draftAssessment in App.js
  - Improved navigation flow for starting new or continuing draft assessments
- **Responsive Design Enhancements**:
  - Optimized mobile view with card-based layout for reports
  - Ensured all information is visible without horizontal scrolling on mobile

## Benefits

1. **Clearer User Flow**: The new location-based approach creates a more intuitive workflow for farmers
2. **Better Mobile Experience**: Card views on mobile provide a more touch-friendly interface
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between in-progress assessments and completed reports
4. **More Historical Context**: Additional historical reports allow for better trend analysis over time
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Removal of unnecessary fields (Status, Report Type) simplifies the interface
