# Logo Update for Beet Guru App

This update implements the new Beet Guru logo throughout the application, replacing the previous placeholder logos with the official branding.

## Changes Made

### New Assets
- Added two logo variants to the application:
  - `BeetGuruSq.png`: Square logo with beet character used in navigation
  - `BeetGuruWide.png`: Wide logo with text used in authentication screens

### Authentication Screens
- Updated the Login screen to use the wide logo variant
- Updated the Registration screen to use the wide logo variant
- Sized the logo appropriately (height: 7rem) to match design specifications
- Maintained consistent placement and styling across both screens

### Navigation Components
- Replaced the placeholder "B" logo in the Header component with the square logo
- Replaced the placeholder "B" logo in the Sidebar component with the square logo
- Maintained the "Beet Guru" text label alongside the square logo
- Applied consistent sizing (height: 2.5rem) and styling to the logo in both components
- Kept rounded corners on the square logo for visual consistency

## Implementation Details

### Asset Management
- Logo files are stored in the root of the `src` directory for direct importing
- Images are imported using standard React import syntax:
  ```javascript
  import beetGuruSquareLogo from '../../BeetGuruSq.png';
  import beetGuruWideLogo from '../../BeetGuruWide.png';
  ```

### Logo Implementation
- Wide logo (Login/Register screens):
  ```jsx
  <img 
    src={beetGuruWideLogo} 
    alt="Beet Guru Logo" 
    className="h-28 w-auto" 
  />
  ```

- Square logo (Navigation components):
  ```jsx
  <img 
    src={beetGuruSquareLogo} 
    alt="Beet Guru Logo" 
    className="h-10 w-10 mr-3 rounded-full" 
  />
  ```

### Technical Considerations
- Used direct imports for simplicity and straightforward implementation
- Applied responsive sizing through Tailwind CSS classes
- Maintained consistent styling across all components
- Ensured the logos look good on all screen sizes
- Added appropriate `alt` text for accessibility

## Visual Impact

The new logo creates a consistent visual identity throughout the application:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Users are greeted with the full Beet Guru brand logo on login and registration screens
2. **In-App Experience**: The compact square logo appears in navigation elements, maintaining brand presence without taking excessive space
3. **Brand Consistency**: The same visual language is used across both mobile and desktop interfaces

## Testing

The implementation has been tested in multiple screen sizes to ensure proper rendering and visual consistency:
- Mobile view (< 768px)
- Tablet view (768px - 1024px)
- Desktop view (> 1024px)
