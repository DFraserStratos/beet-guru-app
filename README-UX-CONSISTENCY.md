# UX Consistency Update

This branch focuses on improving the visual consistency between different screens in the Beet Guru app, specifically aligning the Assessments screen with the design language used in the Locations screen.

## Changes Made

### AssessmentsScreen.js
- Added a proper header section with title, description, and "New Assessment" button
- Updated the layout to match the Locations screen visual style
- Replaced custom button with the standardized FormButton component
- Improved empty state visualization with centered content and icon
- Enhanced overall visual hierarchy and spacing

### LocationCard Component
- Redesigned to match the list item style in the Locations screen
- Changed from a card-based layout to a row-based design with location icon
- Improved status badge styling to be more consistent with the UI
- Simplified the action button to a chevron icon for cleaner visual appearance
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving visual consistency

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Consistent Header Pattern**: All main screens now follow the same header pattern with:
   - Title in bold text
   - Descriptive subtitle in lighter color
   - Primary action button aligned to the right

2. **Unified List Presentation**: List items across the application now share:
   - Consistent spacing and padding
   - Similar visual hierarchy for information
   - Standard icon presentation
   - Hover state styling

3. **Enhanced Empty States**: Empty states now provide:
   - Centered layout with proper spacing
   - Iconic representation of the empty state
   - Clear messaging with action guidance
   - Direct action button to resolve the empty state

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users will have a more consistent experience when navigating between screens

- **Enhanced Visual Appeal**: The updated design creates a more polished and professional appearance
- **Better Maintainability**: Using standard components and patterns makes future updates more straightforward
