# UX Consistency Update

This branch focuses on improving the visual consistency between different screens in the Beet Guru app, establishing a unified visual language across the Assessments, Reports, and Locations screens.

## Visual Language Guide

The Beet Guru application now follows a consistent visual language across all major screens. This visual language is characterized by:

### Layout Structure
- **Card-Based Containers**: Content is organized in rounded white cards with subtle shadows
- **Consistent Spacing**: 1.5rem (24px) spacing between major UI elements
- **Full-Width Cards**: Cards extend to the full width of the container on mobile
- **Responsive Grid**: Desktop views use grid layouts where appropriate

### Typography
- **Page Titles**: 1.5rem (24px), bold, dark gray (#1F2937)
- **Section Headers**: 1.25rem (20px), bold, dark gray
- **Descriptive Subtitles**: 1rem (16px), regular, medium gray (#4B5563)
- **Body Text**: 0.875rem (14px), regular, dark gray
- **Supporting Text**: 0.75rem (12px), regular, light gray

### Color Palette

  - Clear messaging with primary and secondary text
  - Action button when applicable
  - Appropriate padding and spacing

- **Action Buttons**:
  - Green background for primary actions
  - White text for primary action buttons
  - Icon + text for clarity
  - Consistent sizing and padding

- **Form Elements**:
  - Label above input

3. **Enhanced Empty States**: Empty states now provide:
   - Centered layout with proper spacing
   - Iconic representation of the empty state
   - Clear messaging with action guidance
   - Direct action button to resolve the empty state (when applicable)

4. **Consistent Card Patterns**: Mobile card views now follow consistent patterns:

      </p>
    </div>
    {actionButton && (
      <FormButton 
        variant="primary" 
        icon={<IconComponent size={16} />}
        onClick={handleAction}
      >
        Action Text
      </FormButton>
    )}
  </div>
</div>
```

### List Item Pattern
```jsx
<ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
  {items.map((item) => (
    <li key={item.id} className="hover:bg-gray-50">
      <div className="p-4">
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <div className="h-10 w-10 rounded-full bg-green-100 flex items-center justify-center mr-3">
            <Icon size={20} className="text-green-600" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-base font-medium text-gray-800">{item.title}</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{item.description}</p>
            {item.metadata && (
              <p className="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1">{item.metadata}</p>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

### Empty State Pattern

  <Icon size={48} className="text-gray-300 mx-auto mb-4" />
  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-600 mb-2">No items found</h3>
  <p className="text-gray-500 mb-6">
    Descriptive message about empty state
  </p>
  {actionButton && (
    <FormButton 
      variant="primary" 
      icon={<ActionIcon size={16} />}
      onClick={handleAction}
    >
      Action Text
