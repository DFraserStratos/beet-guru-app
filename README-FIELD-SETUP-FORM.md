# Field Setup Form Updates

This document outlines the recent changes and improvements made to the Field Setup form in the assessment wizard.

## Overview

The Field Setup step is a critical part of the assessment process, allowing farmers to input key measurements and estimates that inform the crop yield calculations. These changes reorganize the form into logical sections and add additional fields for more comprehensive data collection.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Reorganized Form Structure

- **Distinct Sections**: Split the form into two clear sections with visual separation:
  - Field Measurements: Physical dimensions of the sample area
  - Dry Matter Estimates: Expected dry matter content of the crop
  
- **Visual Organization**:
  - Added section headers with appropriate styling
  - Maintained consistent spacing and layout across sections
  - Ensured mobile and desktop layouts both display correctly

### 2. New Field Measurements Section

- **Core Fields**:
  - Row Spacing (m): Distance between planted rows
  - Measurement Length (m): Length of the sample area being measured
  
- **Calculation Enhancement**:
  - Added real-time calculation of total measurement area in square meters
  - Formula: Row Spacing × Measurement Length = Area (m²)
  - Visual display with calculator icon and proper units
  - Updates dynamically as values change
  - Shows default values (0.5m × 4m = 2.00m²) when fields are empty

### 3. New Dry Matter Estimates Section

- **Added Fields**:
  - Bulb Estimate (DM%): Expected dry matter percentage of bulbs
  - Leaf Estimate (DM%): Expected dry matter percentage of leaves
  
- **Value Type Toggle**:
  - Added toggle between "Estimate" and "Actual" value types
  - Styled to match the water type toggle on the Crop Details page
  - Visual feedback for the selected option

### 4. Form Handling Improvements

- **Field Editability**:
  - All fields can now be edited and cleared by the user
  - Added placeholders showing expected values when fields are empty
  - Default values (Row Spacing: 0.5m, Measurement Length: 4m, etc.) appear as placeholders
  
- **Field Validation**:
  - Numeric inputs with appropriate min/max values
  - Step increments for decimal precision (0.01 for row spacing, 0.1 for others)
  - Clear visual feedback for input values

### 5. State Management Enhancements

- **Local State Management**:
  - Implemented local form state to improve field control
  - Ensures changes propagate correctly to parent components
  - Prevents form fields from reverting to defaults when cleared
  
- **Calculation Logic**:
  - Dynamic recalculation whenever field values change
  - Graceful handling of empty or invalid inputs
  - Maintains usability with empty fields

## Visual Design

- Maintained the existing app's visual language
- Used green color theme for the area calculation display
- Consistent spacing and layout following app standards
- Responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop
- Added appropriate icons for visual enhancement

## Technical Implementation

- Updated component initializes with sensible defaults but allows user editing
- Used React's `useEffect` for recalculating derived values
- Properly structured form fields with labels, inputs, and help text
- Added appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Developer Notes

- The `localFormData` state ensures fields can be cleared without reverting to defaults
- Proper input validation is applied to prevent invalid data entry
- Area calculation uses default values when fields are empty to maintain usability
- All field handling follows React's controlled component pattern

## User Experience Improvements

- Clearer organization of related fields
- Immediate feedback on measurement area
- Better visual hierarchy with section headers
- Placeholder text helps users understand expected values
- Improved mobile experience with appropriate spacing

This update improves the Field Setup form's usability while maintaining its core functionality and adding valuable enhancements like the area calculation feature.
